        <li>this <strong>egg</strong> is very yummy and delicious because you get to put vinegar on it which is really just a <strong>bonus</strong></li>

        <li>rofl i forgot one more thing, you will feel the beak break in your mouth which is the least appealing occurrence during consumption</li>
